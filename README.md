# CS250 - Software Development Lifecycle

## Project Three - Sprint Review and Retrospective
For this project, we worked with a fictional company named "SNHU Travel" in order to emulate the Agile SDLC framework experience.
Through the course of 8 weeks, we took on the various roles in an Agile team: Product Owner, Scrum Master, testers, and developers.

One major part of the process, as the Product Owner, was the creation of the list of "user stories", or the list of features and pieces of work that need to be done in order for the software to be considered complete. By using these user stories, it helps with the development of the software because it allows the testers and developers to have a clear vision of what needs to be done. Without this, developers might start implementing various features which might not be valuable or beneficial to the end users. By having the Product Owner make this list of user stories based on the input from the stakeholders themselves, we know that we'll be delivering exactly what the client is looking for.

Previously, I had developed programs without this list of user stories, or even a real roadmap of what needs to be done, and rather only focused on the much larger picture. If I had taken the time to develop all of the necessary things that would be required to make the software work, it would take much less time, and the code itself would likely have been more clean in the long run. In the future, I will try to employ the lessons we've learned as part of this class so that I can make even better software, which provides the most value.
